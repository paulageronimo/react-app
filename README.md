# Mess Messaging

## Problem

It can be hard to manage all chats and messaging services, like Skype, sack, What’s up, Viber, telegram, Google hangouts, etc. Try to build a universal messenger that combines them all. 

## The must-be functionality

- Support of as many messengers and chats as you are able to set, the UI that allows users to switch between them quickly
- Provide support for 5 messengers in most demand in your region and meet all requirements above. After that look through the list below.

## Tasks to tackle

- Add the ability to manage multiple accounts in any messenger.
    - This function can be very helpful for businesses and very challenging for you: how many messengers can you set up with multiple accounts?
- Expand the functionality with synchronization of services across all devices you log in on so you don’t need to add it manually every time on a new device.
- Allow your app to set rules for prioritization of the notifications by putting them on the top.
- Just add MORE messaging services and chats!

## Extra considerations

- Support of push notifications for mobile and desktop
- Multilingual
- Ensuring the privacy of personal messages
